## Snipping features
Screen Snip features a few features for letting you screenshotting your screen:
- Rectangle Mode: it does what it do - hides the window and lets you select a rectangle area of the screen
- Free Move: this lets you precisely change the position and the dimension of your snipping area, before taking the screenshot. This may be useful if you need some precise screenshots.

## Recording features
While recording, you can decide between three different modes:
- Follow: the recording smoothly follows your mouse around your screen, best when you are moving a lot around the screen and want a smooth record

- Pointer: the recording is always centered on your mouse
- Fixed: records the area of the screen you've set. To set it up, just press "Capture Area" to open where the recording will take place; then, you can move thearea around the screen, or resize it as you wish.

Additionally, you can decide between a variety of options, including the ability of having mouse clicks highlighted, not recording the mouse pointer, or also recording your entire screen.
Unlike the brand new Windows 11 Snipping Tool also, this one has also a timeout feature when you record, so you can adjust whatever you want before hitting "Record".

With the Previewing feature you can also check  your recording area while recording (only if the recording area is 200x200 or lower), or look at your recorded feature before saving it.

Even if your recording area is bigger than 200x200, in order to not make the app area too cluttered, an external Video Playback window opens, letting you to see the entirety of the recording. The options at your disposal are really a lot!
